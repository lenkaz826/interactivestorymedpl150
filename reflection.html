    <h1>Reflection</h1>

    <p>
        An interactive story can be memorable and fun, whether or not it has a written story. That’s why it matters how you maneuver space, movement, and choices across pages. As my nickname Dormiveglia, which I use on my social media, and as the title of my first short movie, I decided to explore the state between sleep and wakefulness. The illusion of a choice we get during dreams. And it was interesting to see how visual changes can deliver a precise story and idea without further explanation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The decisions that bring you to the end. As each choice seems to be small, it brings you to the main outcome and experience. Some choices bring you to a warm resolution but mostly it’s all distorted. I wanted the story to feel like it’s in a loop from the beginning to the end.
    </p>

    <p>
        The abandoned staircase, flickering lamp, bright light, spiraling stairs, these are all metaphors for life and dreams. Things that we think we have control over, but in reality we don’t.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even though I didn’t use full paragraphs to describe the story, images and little prompts helped me go through it without confusing the user interface. So in this, the viewer is the active participant, projecting their own feelings onto the journey rather than being told how to feel.
